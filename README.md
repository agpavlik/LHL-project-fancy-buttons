# Project: Fancy Buttons!
This project helps reinforce React knowledge. This project is about creating buttons that will change their state when we interact with them! 
Each button have a specific behavior:
- The counter button will keep track how many times we click on it.
- The angry button will change colour to get more red until it reaches a maximum threshold.
- The light switch button will turn on and off when clicked.
- The text repeater button will copy the text of the button over and over.
